# Project-Catwalk: GRAPH GANG

PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS:
1.) Construct a front-end web application that functions and looks like a client-facing retail web-portal.
2.) The application includes a product detail page, a questions and answers page, and a ratings and reviews page.
3.) The application utilizes these technologies:
  a) React - render our front-end
  b) Express - run our server
  c) Axios - make requests to server/github api
  d) Jest/Enzyme - test React components and server functionality
  e) Babel/Webpack - compiles all our files into one bundle.js
  f) Luxon - formats dates into human-readable date-times

START UP INSTRUCTIONS:
1.) On initialization run npm install.
2.) Then type npm run dev:react in the terminal.
3.) Then type npm run server-dev in a new terminal.
4.) To run tests type npm test.

NOTE: Upon cloning of repo, create a config.js file using config.example.js as a template. A github token is needed to run application successfully. (Axios requests are made to a github api for data).
